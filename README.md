Initialize an Anchor workspace in your **current directory** â€” no more folder regrets.

## Why?

If you've ever started writing a new Solana smart contract with Anchor, you might have done this:

1. Create a folder manually  
2. Start writing some code  
3. Realize you should've run `anchor init project_name`  
4. Delete everything  
5. Start over  

That sucks. `anchor-it-here` fixes this.

## What it does

This CLI tool allows you to:

- Initialize a new Anchor workspace in your **current working directory**
- Avoid `anchor init project_name` and folder reorganization
- Save time and stay in flow

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g anchor-it-here
